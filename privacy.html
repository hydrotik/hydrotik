This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="{companyURL}">http://www.hydrotik.com</a> (hereinafter, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;<!-- -->http://www.hydrotik.com<!-- -->&quot;). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy (&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p><p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms of service posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms of service.</p><h2 class="my-4">Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->&#x27;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->&#x27;s visitors use its website. From time to time, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p><p>Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <!-- -->http://www.hydrotik.com<!-- --> blog posts. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p><h2 class="my-4">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->&#x27;s websites choose to interact with <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> in ways that require <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <!-- -->http://www.hydrotik.com<!-- --> to provide a username and email address.</p><h2 class="my-4">Security</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><h2 class="my-4">Advertisements</h2><p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p><h2 class="my-4">Links To External Sites</h2><p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->&#x27;s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->, third parties or the public at large.</p><p>If you are a registered user of <!-- -->http://www.hydrotik.com<!-- --> and have supplied your email address, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#x27;s going on with <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><h2 class="my-4">Aggregated Statistics</h2><p>Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p><h2 class="my-4">Affiliate Disclosure</h2><p>This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links.

In each case, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor&#x27;s interaction with <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><h2 class="my-4">Business Transfers</h2><p>If <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><h2 class="my-4">Privacy Policy Changes</h2><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- -->&#x27;s sole discretion. <!-- -->Hydrotik LLC<!-- --> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p></div></main><footer class="bg-gray-900"><ul class="flex items-center justify-between max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4 md:p-8 text-sm text-white"><li>© 2020 Hydrotik LLC</li><li><a class="block text-white" href="">Terms and Conditions</a></li><li><a class="block text-white" href="">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a class="block text-white" href="https://github.com/hydrotik/hydrotik" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></li><li><a class="block text-white" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donovanadams/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a class="block text-white" href="http://www.hydrotik.com/portfolio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Portfolio</a></li></ul></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/privacy","query":{},"buildId":"_GjFnzRC3iAT1tiaV-xFJ","assetPrefix":"/hydrotik","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/hydrotik/_next/static/runtime/polyfills-7e15df068e5f52bf69fa.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/_app" src="/hydrotik/_next/static/_GjFnzRC3iAT1tiaV-xFJ/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" data-next-page="/privacy" src="/hydrotik/_next/static/_GjFnzRC3iAT1tiaV-xFJ/pages/privacy.js"></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/runtime/webpack-c212667a5f965e81e004.js" async=""></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/chunks/framework.619a4f70c1d4d3a29cbc.js" async=""></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/chunks/commons.4d8a30a2ebe36a29286e.js" async=""></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/runtime/main-acbde383cbafa78d72e2.js" async=""></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/chunks/4d4c24fa9165deac739e57a9ceec40180d52f963.db69e7f2eaa5091b718c.js" async=""></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/_GjFnzRC3iAT1tiaV-xFJ/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/hydrotik/_next/static/_GjFnzRC3iAT1tiaV-xFJ/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
