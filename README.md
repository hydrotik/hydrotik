# Hydrotik

## Website code for **hydrotik.github.io/hydrotik/** using:

- **Next.js** Node/React framework
- **TypesScript** Strongly typed JavaScript
- **Tailwind** CSS framework
- **Victory** Visualization framework for React
- lodash, pdf-reader, moment.js, papaparse

This is a personal playground of my work that allows me to test ideas, explore mistakes, as well present and evolve my professional brand in a fun way. I've been leading others in development pursuits professionally for quite some time. This is a way for me to carve out time to code, which I still very much enjoy.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
To deploy static site to Github pages. Have a branch setup in Github such as **gh-pages** and run:
```bash
npm deploy gh-pages
```
To deploy to production which includes the API functionality push to master with the Zeit integration, or run:
```bash
npm run build
```
